    <p>My greatest struggles in this lab came from figuring out what I was actually going to make with it as well as converting the java into javaScript. It took me quite a while to actually come up with idea because I felt like chemotaxis was such a broad defintion, so with the help of my peers, I decided I just wanted to make a fun game of destroying bacteria to clean something up. The second problem of converting the java into javascript came from the mousePressed method being used differently in javaScript than in java. In java the mousePressed method will be constantly on if the user is pressing the mouse, but in javaScript the mousePressed method will only be on for one instant the moment you press the mouse. This variation in the use of the method, made my game a lot harder as you actually had to click on each individual bacteria to kill them rather than just sliding over all of them at once. Another issue I had when converting to javaScript was making the bacteria disappear when killed. I worked through this issue by replacing the bacteria object with a new bacteria object that couldn't be seen or pressed once it was killed.</p>
