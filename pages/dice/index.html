    <p>Making this initial project in java using mousePressed was pretty simple. Adding that automatic component was a little tougher for me, but I ended up using frameCount to help do this. Transferring the java code to javaScript was the hardest part for me. I was having trouble getting my numbers to show up and I had to use the console in developer tools and console.log in my code to figure out where things were going wrong. One main problem is that I wasn't telling javaScript what kind of variable I was putting in var which was an int in my case. My other main problem was figuring how to reset my numbers after each redraw and how to get them to actually show up when I was using the text method. My problem was that I was just putting in an int while using the text method even though it requires a string as its first paramater, so I had to add a set of quotes before hand to make it a string. </p>
