    <p>I think the hardest part of this project was figuring out how to make the lightning fade while other lightning bolts are still flashing well, how to make the lightning run automatically, and how to make the rain. For the first problem of trying to get the lightning to fade, I had to include a rectangle the larger than the screen size with a certain fourth parameter in the draw method to cause this sort of fade in the lightning. To make the lightning run automatically, I had to use the frameCount variable to reset the lightning variables at whatever speed I wanted. The third problem came from me wanting my project to be more than just lightning coming down, so I wanted to try and add rain coming down as well. I did this by making another class for Rain, and creating an array of rain objects which were ellipses that would move down the screen each time called in the draw method. </p>
