    <p id=trimesterone>Trimester One Reflection: 
    <br>
    <br>
     Overall I'd say my first trimester of junior year was pretty good. Of course I had a lot of stress and some setbacks, but things have gone well for me both in school and out of school in sports. The cross country season was the best season I've had yet and even though it was extremely disappointing for the whole team when we didn't qualify for state, it wass overall still a great experience. Getting closer with the team and watching all of us grow and improve together this year was just incredible and we have so much to look forward to this spring for track as well as next fall for all the returning runners. When it comes to school itself, I felt pretty good. I feel like I've improved my study habits greatly since freshmen year and it has really helped me even though they still aren't fantastic, but I can always try to improve. I've been doing good in all my classes except for AP Euro which I am struggling with quite a bit, but I'm hoping as the year goes on, I'll be able to find a way to study that works for me. In Advanced Computer Science specifically, I am enjoying it a lot better than last year as the projects are more complicated and we can mostly do what we want. Sometimes being creative is the hardest part for me, but I enjoy the struggle. The only thing I don't like is this quizzes/tests on content from last year because even though we know how to implement it in the code itself, it's hard for me to understand the specific concepts and ideas behind them especially when I don't have a lot of time to go back and extensively review the content. Otherwise the stress that has come with the classes I am taken has been expected, so I am stilll very happy with how I did this trimester and I'm hoping to continue it for the next two.</p>
