    <p id="bio">My name is Pranav Vijay and I am a junior here at RHS. I play two varsity sports for the school, cross country and track, but I plan to go out for nordic skiing this year. I used to play soccer, but this year I decided to stop so I could focus on my running without getting injured as well as have more time for school as club soccer was a huge time commitment. Something I really enjoy is traveling to new places and last summer I got to visit Australia, Singapore, Cambodia, Idonesia, and Thailand which was such a great experience. I took AP Computer Science last year and I really enjoyed the projects and working with java, so I decided to take Advanced Computer Science to see what I can try to create this year.
